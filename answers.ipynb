    "## Practice Overview\n",
    "Employers use interviews to judge your readiness and fit for the job, which includes hearing about your skills and interest in the role. The interview is not a test or exam, but a conversation between you and the employer. Build your own strategies to be prepared come interview day. This project is one of many ways for you to practice!\n",

    "### 2. You are given a ten piece box of chocolate truffles. You know based on the label that six of the pieces have an orange cream filling and four of the pieces have a coconut filling. If you were to eat four pieces in a row, what is the probability that the first two pieces you eat have an orange cream filling and the last two have a coconut filling?\n",
