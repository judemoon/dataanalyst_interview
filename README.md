# Interview Practice for Data Analyst Job 

July-August 2017, by Jude Moon

## Practice Overview
Employers use interviews to judge your readiness and fit for the job, which includes hearing about your skills and interest in the role. The interview is not a test or exam, but a conversation between you and the employer. Build your own strategies to be prepared come interview day. This project is one of many ways for you to practice!

### 1. Describe a data project you worked on recently.

### 2. You are given a ten piece box of chocolate truffles. You know based on the label that six of the pieces have an orange cream filling and four of the pieces have a coconut filling. If you were to eat four pieces in a row, what is the probability that the first two pieces you eat have an orange cream filling and the last two have a coconut filling?

### Follow up question: If you were given an identical box of chocolates and again eat four pieces in a row, what is the probability that exactly two contain coconut filling?

### 3. Construct a query to find the top 5 states with the highest number of active users. Include the number for each state in the query result.

### 4. Define a function `first_unique` that takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeated (unique) character in the input string. If there are no unique characters return None. Note: Your code should be in Python.

### 5. What are underfitting and overfitting in the context of Machine Learning? How might you balance them?

### 6. If you were to start your data analyst position today, what would be your goals a year from now?
